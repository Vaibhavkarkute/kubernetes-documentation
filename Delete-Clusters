Deleting a Kind Cluster Locally
To delete a Kubernetes cluster created with Kind (Kubernetes in Docker), follow these steps:

Basic Cluster Deletion
List your Kind clusters to see what's running:

bash
kind get clusters
Delete a specific cluster (replace cluster-name with your actual cluster name):

bash
kind delete cluster --name cluster-name
Additional Options
If you only have one cluster, you can delete it without specifying the name:

bash
kind delete cluster
To delete all Kind clusters at once:

bash
 for cluster in $(kind get clusters); do kind delete cluster --name $cluster; done
Cleaning Up Docker Resources
After deleting the cluster, you might want to clean up Docker resources:

Remove unused containers, networks, and images:

bash
docker system prune
To be more thorough (this will remove all stopped containers, unused networks, and dangling images):

bash
docker system prune -a
Verification
After deletion, verify the cluster is gone:

bash
kind get clusters
docker ps -a | grep kind
The cluster should no longer appear in these lists.
